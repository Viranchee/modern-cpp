# Modern CPP Programming

Following through Federico Busato's C++ course ( 22 chapter ) for intermediate C++ programmers.

Allowed to add more C++ sources, if, in future, I decide to invest in another Book.

### Learnings other than C++:
 
- Empty commit messages make life easier. Fish Abbrievations make it better to commit faster. No extra time spent on thinking about the commit message.

```fish
abbr -a -g gaa 'git add --all'
abbr -a -g gce 'git commit --allow-empty-message -m " "'
```

- CMakeLists.txt. 
    - Set your C++ compiler
    - Clangd: generate compile_commands.json file

- Github CLI:
    - create PRs, squash merge PRs, pull origin main
    - This is super fast compared to the browser, and keeps me productive


### Things I did not learn thoroughly:

- Template Deduction Guide
- Template Template Arguments
- SFINAE
